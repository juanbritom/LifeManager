# LifeManager

Still in beta because I'm thinking of better ways to implement it, also didn't test button change yet even though I projected it with that in mind.

Installation: Extract the folders to the BepInEx directory inside your game's folder.

Usage: Hold Left or Right Arrow key, then press Up or Down Arrow key to add or remove remaining Life from left/right partner. You can increase/decrease the amount in the config file, although I'm not really sure how the value translates to ingame time value (also there are probably multiple presses happening, and yes, you can hold Up or Down).

(Yes this is a lazy early release for now...but it works)
